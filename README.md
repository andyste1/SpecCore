# SpecCore

This is a simple C# WPF "game engine" inspired by many happy hours spent gaming and programming on my Sinclair ZX Spectrum, in the mid-80s. The 640x320 screen, and blocky 7-colour graphics had a charm of their own. The engine is very simple, and has been loosely based on the Sinclair Basic programming syntax, as has the 60x40 character screen.

The project is just a bit of fun, which I hope brings a smile to the face of 80s kids like me, looking for a bit of nostalgia.
